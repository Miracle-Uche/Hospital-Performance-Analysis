# Introduction
To analyze and visualize hospital performance focusing on admissions, encounters, procedures, and payer activity, to drive data-informed decisions and identify opportunities for operational improvement.
# Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of hospital operations using synthetic healthcare data from a fictional medical facility. The goal was to uncover actionable insights related to admissions, encounters, procedures, and payer activity, driving data-informed decisions for operational improvement.
I explored patient visit trends, insurance coverage efficiency, high-cost procedures, and seasonal admission patterns. This analysis highlights opportunities to reduce financial strain, optimize care delivery, and improve reporting accuracy in a healthcare setting.
